I made this mini coding project while going through ZeroToMastery.io to practice and improve my skills in CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries, and responsive design. The layout has four main sections—green, red, blue, and yellow—each with its own purpose and style. In the green section, I used CSS Grid to set up navigation links and added a media query to change the font size for smaller screens. The red and blue sections use grid-template-columns with auto-fill and minmax to create flexible layouts that fit different screen sizes. For the image containers and footer, I used Flexbox to centre and space the content nicely and easily.
